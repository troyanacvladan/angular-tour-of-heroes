      The assignment occurs synchronously, as if the server could return heroes instantly or the browser could freeze the UI while it waited for the server's response.
      That won't work when the HeroService is actually making requests of a remote server.

      This method version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroesâ€”which could happen now or several minutes from now.
      The subscribe() method passes the emitted array to the callback, which sets the component's heroes property.
      This asynchronous approach will work when the HeroService requests heroes from the server.
