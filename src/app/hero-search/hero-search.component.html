    <!--Notice that the *ngFor iterates over a list called heroes$, not heroes.
    The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.

    Since *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable, use the pipe character (|) followed by async.
    This identifies Angular's AsyncPipe and subscribes to an Observable automatically
    so you won't have to do so in the component class.
